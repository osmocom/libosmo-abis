The two test data files presented here for unit testing of RAA' function are:

d144-ul-input.asc

	This file is generated in Themyscira gsm-net-reveng Hg repository,
	d144 subdirectory.  The original hand-crafted input is a different
	file in the same directory (ul-input); the present *.asc file is
	the output of some helper programs maintained in the same place,
	reformatted to be more directly suitable as a unit test for
	libosmotrau RAA' encoding functions.

nokia-tcsm2-atrau.hex

	This file is the A-interface output from a historical hardware TRAU
	(Nokia TCSM2) whose input was the sequence of 290-bit "user" frames in
	d144-ul-input.asc.  It is raw E1 timeslot output that has been extracted
	in perfect alignment and converted into hexadecimal representation,
	with 80 hex digits per line.

A correct RAA' encoder implementation should produce output identical to
nokia-tcsm2-atrau.hex when fed with d144-ul-input.asc, and vice-versa for
a correct RAA' decoder implementation.
