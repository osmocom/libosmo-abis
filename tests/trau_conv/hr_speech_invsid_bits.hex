# This TW-TS-005 hex file contains an input to osmo_rtp2trau() for GSM-HR
# codec that is *not* a valid RTP payload per TW-TS-002: an invalid SID
# frame for conversion to TRAU-UL that begins as defined in TW-TS-002
# (FT=1 to signify invalid SID), but then contrary to the spec, does
# include the payload data bits.  Such concoction is not valid in RTP
# flight between network elements, but osmo_rtp2trau() supports such
# extended usage in order to allow TFO applications to set the fill bit
# pattern in the TRAU-UL frame to something other than all zeros.
#
# In the present example, this fill bit pattern consists of R0+LPC
# parameters (33 bits) from a valid SID frame, followed by alternating
# 1s and 0s in the 79-bit SID field.
