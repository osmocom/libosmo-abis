# This hex file (TW-TS-005 Annex B format) contains some RTP payloads for
# GSM-HR codec, using the super-5993 RTP payload format of TW-TS-002,
# semantically corresponding to the uplink direction of a GSM call leg.
#
# The present example contains a mix of good and bad frames, the same kind
# of mix that can be represented in a TRAU-UL frame stream.  This example
# has been constructed by hand: some frames were taken from GSM 06.07 test
# sequences and then tweaked, other are outright concoctions.  The setting
# of DTXd bit is also exercised.
